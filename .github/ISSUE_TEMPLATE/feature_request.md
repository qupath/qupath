## IMPORTANT!

If you want to request a new feature in QuPath, the best place to start is with a discussion at https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath

We use GitHub to track the stuff we're working on (or urgently *should* be working on) & want to avoid becoming overwhelmed by discussions & requests that might not be a good fit for the project.

For that reason, feature requests added here that aren't agreed with a core developer - or don't follow the template below - will usually be closed quickly. 

If in doubt, use [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tags/qupath). This helps us keep things organized & also means more people can contribute to the discussion.

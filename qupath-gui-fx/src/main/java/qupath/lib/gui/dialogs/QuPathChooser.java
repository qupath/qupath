/**
 * Interface to help with prompting users to select files or directories.
 * The intension is that sub-classes might use different kinds of (possibly platform-specific) file choosers.
 * <p>
 * In truth, having this as an interface made most sense back in the Swing days - whenever it was often the 
 * case that the Swing and AWT dialogs were quite different in appearance (and pleasantness).
 * <p>
 * With JavaFX that's not so important - however it is maintained as an interface in case alternative dialogs 
 * might be introduced in the future.

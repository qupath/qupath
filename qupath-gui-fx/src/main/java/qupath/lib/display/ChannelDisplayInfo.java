import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;

/**
 * Interface used to control the display of single channels of image data, where
 * 'single channel' means one value per pixel (in Java's parlance, one band for the
 * SampleModel).  This applies not only to the 'default' channels in an image -
 * e.g. red, green and blue for an RGB image - but also to 'derived' channels computed
 * by a transformation, e.g. color deconvolution.
 * <p>
 * The primary uses are:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li> to extract floating point pixel values for the channel from a BufferedImage
 * 		(either directly, or via some color transformation that may involve
 * 		 more than one channel/band from the BufferedImage)
 * 	<li> to generate RGB pixel values suitable for visualizing the raw channel values
 * 		extracted above, including the storage of any lookup tables required
 * 	<li> to store min/max display values, which influence the lookup table mapping to RGB
 * 		(i.e. to store brightness/contrast values)
 * 	<li> to update an existing RGB value, to facilitate creating composite images that depict
 *      the values of multiple channels in a single, merged visualization
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As such, its uses lie somewhere between Java's SampleModel and ColorModel classes.
 * <p>
 * Its reason for existing is that sometimes we need to be able to adjust the display of channels
 * individually and to create merges - particularly in the case of fluorescence images - but
 * to simplify whole slide image support we need to be able to do this on-the-fly.
 * Switching the ColorModel for an existing BufferedImage is somewhat awkward, and when caching
 * image tiles we want to be able to keep the original ColorModels intact - otherwise ColorModels
 * for recently-seen tiles might be different from the ColorModels of tiles that have been in the cache
 * for longer, even though they were read from the same image servers.  Furthermore, 'unknown' image types
 * (i.e. not standard RGB/BGR/single-channel images) don't always behave nicely with Graphics objects
 * if we want to paint or scale them.
 * <p>
 * Using the ChannelDisplayInfo approach means that during repainting an (A)RGB image can be produced on-the-fly
 * without needing to create a new image with the desired ColorModel for painting.
 * This potentially ends up requiring a bit more computation that is really necessary - and it may be optimized
 * better in the future - but it was the simplest method I could come up with to provide the features I wanted...

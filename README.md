QuPath is open source software for whole slide image analysis and digital pathology.

QuPath has been developed as a research tool at Queen's University Belfast.  It offers a wide range of functionality, including:

* extensive tools for annotation and visualization
* workflows for both IHC and H&E analysis
* novel algorithms for common tasks, e.g. cell segmentation, Tissue microarray dearraying
* interactive machine learning, e.g. for cell and texture classification
* an object-based hierarchical data model, with scripting support
* extensibility, to add new features or support for different image sources
* easy integration with other tools, e.g. MATLAB and ImageJ

All in all, QuPath aims to provide researchers with a new set of tools to help with bioimage analysis in a way that is both user- and developer-friendly.

QuPath is free and open source, using GPLv3.

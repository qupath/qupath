## Version 0.6.0-SNAPSHOT

This is a *work in progress* for the next major release.

Some things may be added, some things may be removed, and some things may look different before the final release.

*QuPath v0.6.0 requires Java 21 or later*

### Major features
* Support for InstanSeg segmentation (https://github.com/instanseg/instanseg)
* Read and write OME-Zarr images (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1474)
  * Use `convert-ome` to write OME-Zarr from a command line
  * Use *File → Export images... → OME-Zarr* to export images from the user interface

### Enhancements
(These are not yet ordered by interestingness)

* Support system light/dark color themes
* Improved display of annotation names (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1532)
* Support log10 counts with histograms (no longer use natural log) (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1540)
  * Log counts also now available in measurement tables
* Prompt to save modified scripts when closing QuPath (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1524)
* Close most sub-windows from the keyboard with `Ctrl/Cmd + W` or `Esc` (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1548)
* Project browser improvements (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1556)
  * Project thumbnails can be hidden or their size adjusted from a context menu
  * Images remain sorted after adding new metadata values
  * A warning indicator is shown if image files are missing
    * Use the 'Skip file checks in projects' preference if you need to turn this off (e.g. your images are on a slow network)
* Project sorting is persistent when projects are re-opened (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1584)
* Create a new channel as a linear combination of other channels (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1566)
* Simplify `TileClassificationsToAnnotationsPlugin` implementation (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1563)
* Add methods to `PathObjectHierarchy` to simplify requesting objects for regions (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1563)
* TMA cores can now have classifications assigned to them
  * Default color for TMA cores is lighter (to make it easier to see on both bright and dark backgrounds)
  * TMA core 'missing' status is now shown using opacity, not a different color, to preserve any classification color
* Faster *Run for project* scripts when the image doesn't need to be loaded (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1489)
  * This can substantially speed up _some_ scripts that don't need to access pixel data (e.g. for most measurement export)
* Initial core support for stain normalization and background subtraction (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1554)
  * Experimental - not yet a full feature or available through the user interface!
* Add `TransformedServerBuilder.convertType(PixelType)` to convert pixel types
* Right-click on 'Measurement map' colorbar to copy it to the system clipboard (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1583)
* Context help can warn if a classification color is similar to the default object color
* Improvements to 'Selection mode'
  * New icon & other drawing icons change to indicate when they are active in selection mode
  * Selection mode works with line ROIs, selecting any intersecting objects
  * Temporarily active 'Selection mode' by pressing the `S` key while interacting with a viewer
* More viewer options are persistent (e.g. show/hide the overview thumbnail, location text, or scalebar)
* Better support for symbolic links (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1586)
* Bio-Formats preference to open remote images is now turned on by default (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1653)
  * This is needed to open remote ome.zarr images - but can be turned off in the preferences if necessary
* Self-contained projects that contain all images inside the project directory no longer prompt the user to update URIs if moved (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1668)
* Channel names can now be set for all fluorescence images, even if they are RGB (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1659)
  * Note that channel colors still only be set for non-RGB images
* Improved ImageJ integration (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1676 https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1677)
* 'Selection mode' now supports 'deselecting' objects by pressing the 'Alt' key (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1704)

### Experimental features
These features are included for testing and feedback.
They may change or be removed in future versions.
* 'Dynamic detection line thickness (experimental)' preference (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1623)
  * Experimental preference to adjust how detections are displayed when zoomed in
* New toolbar button to show/hide 'neighbors' in the viewer (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1597)
  * Note that the *Delaunay cluster features 2D* command is now deprecated - see https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1590 for details
    * If you use this command, the calculated connections are displayed instead of the default neighbor connections for compatibility.
      However, this support will be removed in a future version.

### Bugs fixed
* Tile export to .ome.tif can convert to 8-bit unnecessarily (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1494)
* Brightness/Contrast 'Apply to similar images' fails to update settings immediately across viewers (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1499)
* Full image annotation for Sparse training image throws errors for detections (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1443)
  Channel name can sometimes change when using the quick channel color selector (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1500)
* TileExporter exports ImageJ TIFFs with channels converted to z-stacks (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1503)
* Black row or column appears on some downsampled images (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1527)
* Full image annotations can be shifted accidentally outside the image bounds (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1533)
* Search distance when selecting points in the viewer is too low (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1552)
* `ImageOps.Core.replace()` does not work as expected (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1564)
* QuPath doesn't always use the specified file extension when exporting snapshots (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1567)
* Out-of-bounds tiles can result in detected cells being in the wrong place (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1606)
* Spacebar can be locked in an 'on' position within viewers (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1610)
* Timepoint data is rarely available (or correct) (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1628)
* Some commands cannot be run from 'Command List' (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1647)
* ROIs with small pieces could look very 'pointy' when viewed at low resolution (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1681)
* Create training image does not work properly for z-stacks / time series (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1701)
* Channel colors are not stored properly when using saved display settings (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1726)
* 'Split annotations by lines' does not work for z-stacks or time-series if line thickness > 0 (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1729)

### API changes
* New `Map<String, String> getMetadata()` method added to `PathObject`, `Project` and `ProjectImageEntry` (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1587)
  * Supports storing key/value `String` pairs
  * Use judiciously with `PathObject`! Adding metadata to any object can increase its memory footprint - 
    for detections, it is best to try to avoid adding even a single value because then no 
    storage needs to be created.
  * `qupath.lib.objects.MetadataStore` is deprecated and will be removed in the next release - 
    along with older metadata-related methods in `PathObject` and `ProjectImageEntry`
  * _Extensions with subclasses may need updated for compatibity by implementing `getMetadata()`_
* The `MeasurementList` interface has been substantially revised (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pulls)
  * Removed methods had been deprecated since v0.4.0; the changes mostly focus on simplifying the API, improving 
    thread-safety, and squashing some bugs.
* `PathObject` and `PathObjectHierarchy` have also been revised, with deprecated methods removed
  * New `PathObject.getClassification()` and `PathObject.setClassification(String)` methods 
    to simplify working with classifications in scripts (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1593)
* `ObjectMeasurements` names cell intensity measurements in the order `Compartment: Channel: Measurement`
  * This is a change from `Channel: Compartment: Measurement` to make it easier to find measurements in the list
  * *This will affect the use of the QuPath StarDist extension*
* `ImageServer.finalize()` is no longer overridden to call `close()` in case the caller forgets
  * `finalize()` is deprecated for removal; any class that relied on this should consider using `Cleaner`
* Remove `BioImageioSpec` from `QP.getCoreClasses()`

### Build changes
* Use Kotlin instead of Groovy for QuPath's build scripts (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1696)
  * Also refactor and simplify the build scripts
  * Extension writers can use either Groovy or Kotlin - but may need to make some changes to their build scripts

* TMA and annotation grid views throw exception if the width is too small (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1473)
* Extensions can't be loaded from sub-directories of the extension directory (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1461)
* OpenSlide is not available when running from command line (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1447)
* `convert-ome` always returns 0 even if it fails (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1451)
* Grid views don't show objects by default if no measurements are available (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1472)
* Reducing the number of open viewers can break QuPath & require it to be restarted (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1469)
* Exception when opening script if the last directory isn't available (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1441)
* 'Show grayscale' sometimes show an extra channel when multiple viewers are used (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1468)
* Displaying large numbers of thumbnails in a project is too slow (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1446)
* Mini viewer isn't updated if the aspect ratio of its parent viewer is "portrait" rather than "landscape (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1697)

### Enhancement

## Version 0.5.0

This is a **major update**, with many enhancements and new features.

> **Important!** Some older extensions will need to be updated to work with QuPath v0.5.

### Enhancements

#### User interface
* New toolbar badges & context help
  * Click the `?` icon in the toolbar to view the help
  * Find tips or warnings to help avoid common errors
* Major upgrade to the brightness/contrast/channels command, including
  * Save/restore display settings in projects
    * Import display settings by drag & drop
  * Optionally view log counts for channel histograms
  * For multi-channel (non-RGB images):
    * Better support to toggle channels on/off
    * Remember previous selection when switching between grayscale & color
    * More quickly change channel colors (the square icon is now a color picker)
* Better support for viewing multiple images simultaneously
  * New 'Grid size' commands to quickly create a grid of viewers
  * Optionally synchronize display settings across images
  * Optionally 'detach' a viewer to see it in a separate window
  * 'Synchronize viewers' is now a persistent preference, which is turned *off* by default
* *'Zoom to fit'* is now a regular button, not a persistent toggle button
  * Clicking 'Zoom to fit' updates the current viewer, but doesn't 'lock' its status to block panning/zooming further
* Completely new log viewer to access more logging information
  * Find the code at https://github.com/qupath/log-viewer
  * Includes badge to highlight errors that have occurred when the log viewer is closed
  * Information about the logger class & thread
* New extension manager to add, remove & update extensions
* New toolbar buttons for the script editor `</>`, log viewer, fill/unfill annotations
* *File → Export snapshots* supports PNG, JPEG and TIFF (not just PNG)
* New option to set the font size in the script editor
  * *View → Set font size*
* Support sorting project entries by name, ID, and URI
  * Right-click on the project list to access the *Sort by...* menu
* Improved script editor auto-complete (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1357)
  * Activate with *Ctrl + space*, cancel with *Esc*
  * Completions update while typing
* Support for regular expressions in several 'filter' fields, e.g. for projects, channels, log messages & measurements
* `MeasurementList.asMap()` returns `Map<String, Number` rather than `Map<String, Double>`
  * This enables scripts to use `pathObject.measurements['Name'] = 2` rather than `pathObject.measurements['Name'] = 2d`
* *View → Show command list* supports copying commands to the clipboard
  * This helps when creating docs or answering forum posts that need specific commands
* New *Startup script path* preference
  * Support running a single Groovy script when QuPath launches (useful for customization)
  * The preference can also be overridden with the system property `qupath.startup.script=/path/to/script.groovy` 
    or blocked with `qupath.startup.script=false` (e.g. in QuPath.cfg)

#### Naming & measurements
* Improve consistency of naming, including for measurements
  * Use 'classification' rather than 'class' (to reduce confusion with Java 'classes')
  * Add a new 'Object type' measurement to tables, giving a readable string ('Annotation', 'Detection', 'Cell' etc.)
  * No longer show a default 'Name' if no name has been set
    * e.g. don't show 'PathAnnotationObject' or the classification as a placeholder, since this causes confusion for people writing scripts and requesting the name

#### Processing & analysis
* Includes *pre-release* of OpenSlide 4.0.0
  * Final OpenSlide v4.0.0 release expected to be included in QuPath v0.5.0
  * Supports Apple Silicon without needing to install it separately (see below)
  * Optionally set a directory in QuPath's preferences to use your *own* OpenSlide build
* Faster processing & reduced memory use for pixel classification measurements (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1332)
* New *Objects → Annotations... → Split annotations by lines* command (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1349)
* New `ObjectMerger` class to simplify creating new tile-based segmentation methods (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1346)
* New `Tiler` class to generate tiles within other objects (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1347) (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1349) (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1277)
* Replaced `PluginRunner` with `TaskRunner` to more easily run tasks with a progress bar (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1360)

#### Command line
* System properties can be passed via the command line using Java `-D` syntax
  * Example `QuPath -DPYTORCH_VERSION=1.13.1 -Doffline=false`
  * These are set as QuPath is being launched, before the user interface is created

#### Platforms
* Much improved Apple Silicon support, including with OpenSlide
  * See [below](#important-info-for-mac-users) for details

#### Import & export
* SVG export now supports overlays (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1272)

#### Code refactoring
* New `qupath-fxtras` project for general-purpose JavaFX use
  * Code at https://github.com/qupath/qupath-fxtras
* Ongoing work to simplify QuPath's code & API, including
  * Previous `Dialogs` class has moved to `qupath-fxtras`
  * `ActionTools` has changed package
  * Much smaller `QuPathGUI` class
  * *These changes will require some extensions to be updated*
* Initial work to support string localization
* `DnnModel` simplified
  * Generic parameter removed; see javadoc for details

### Bugs fixed

* 'Run for project' does not recognize when previous images have been deleted (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1291)
* ProjectCommands.promptToImportImages always returns an empty list (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1251)
* PathIO doesn't restore backup if writing ImageData fails (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1252)
* Scripts open with the caret at the bottom of the text rather than the top (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1258)
* 'Synchronize viewers' ignores z and t positions (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1220)

* Slide label can be too big for the screen (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1263)
* Slide label doesn't update as expected when changing the image (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1246)
* Several bug fixes in the view tracker (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1329)
* Occasional misleading 'Reader is null - was the image already closed?' exceptions (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1265)
* Using existing channel names (e.g. 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue') for color deconvolution can confuse brightness/contrast settings (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1245)
* The centroid-to-centroid distance between an object & itself can be > 0 (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1249)
* Importing objects from .qpdata including TMA cores can result in an 'invisible' TMA grid (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1303)


### Important info for Mac users

#### Improved Apple Silicon support

The inclusion of all-new OpenSlide builds has enabled us to include better support for Apple Silicon.

This means that *almost everything* in QuPath should now work on recent M1/M2 Macs. 
The only exception is that Bio-Formats does not support Apple Silicon for a subset of file formats, specifically
* Images with JPEG-XR compression
  * The includes most CZI whole slide images from Zeiss
* Images that use libjpeg-turbo
  * This includes NDPI files - but most of these can be read with OpenSlide anyway

Apple Silicon users can download the x64 (Intel) version for use with these formats.

#### Installed packages include the version & architecture

*QuPath.app* is now renamed to *QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app* (Intel processors) or *QuPath-v0.5.0-aarch64.app* (Apple Silicon).

The more awkward naming is in recognition of the fact that users often want to retain multiple versions of QuPath on their computer.
Also, many Apple Silicon users may require installing *both* versions if they need to work with a mixture of supported and unsupported file formats.

Previously, versions could replace one another unless they were manually renamed - but that is no longer required.

#### Installation notes

Because QuPath is not signed, it is necessary to right-click and choose *Open* to run it for the first time [as described here](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/installation.html).

Before release, there was also a problem on some Macs where QuPath didn't have permission to access files.
This is hopefully resolved now, but if it occurs then launching QuPath from `Terminal.app` can help, e.g.
```
/Applications/QuPath-v0.5.0-x64.app/Contents/MacOS/QuPath
```

#### QuPath will require macOS 11 in the future

After v0.5, QuPath will require macOS 11 or later to run on Mac.

This is because of recent changes in JavaFX - for more details, see [here](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/master/doc-files/release-notes-21.md#javafx-requires-macos-11-or-later) and [here](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8308114).

#### Startup may be slower

QuPath may take a little longer to start up than previously, especially with macOS 14. 
This appears to be related to time spent initializing JavaFX.

> #### Important!
> 
> With so many changes, it's possible that some new bugs have snuck in.
> It's **strongly recommmended** to try v0.4.0 cautiously & backup any important data or QuPath projects first.
>
> Please report any bugs or ask questions at [**Scientific Community Image Forum**](https://forum.image.sc/tag/qupath).
> 
> Also, QuPath v0.4.0 is mostly compatible with v0.3.x, but makes some changes to data files that v0.3.x doesn't support (e.g. adding object IDs). 
> Therefore it's **strongly recommmended** not to switch between versions for analyzing data.

  * New command 'Objects > Select... > Select objects on current plane' can achieve the same when not using selection mode
* Panning with synchronized viewers now corrects for different rotations
* Multi-view commands now available through 'View' menu (and not only right-clicking a viewer)
  * These make it possible to create grid of viewers, to work with multiple images simultaneously

* Avoid converting the pixel type to 32-bit unnecessarily when sending image regions to ImageJ


#### Script editor improvements
* Syntax highlighting for Markdown, JSON, YAML and XML documents
* Added 'Replace/Next' and 'Replace all' features to *Find* window (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/898)
* New lines now trigger caret following (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/900)
* Proper tab handling (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/902)
* Introduction of 'Smart Editing' (enabled through the corresponding preference under 'Edit'), which supports the following features:
  * Brace block handling (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/901)
  * Smart parentheses and (double/single) quotes (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/907)

* Prompt the user to reload data if 'Run for project' may have made changes for any images that are currently open
* New 'Recent scripts...' menu item to reopen scripts more easily
* Log messages are now color-coded, making errors and warnings easier to spot (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1079)
* 'Run for project' can use metadata when selecting images
  * If the filter text doesn't contain `|`, just filter by image name (the previous behavior)
  * If the filter text contains `|`, additionally split on `|` and check that all tokens are either contained in the image name, or in a metadata text in the format `key=value`
  * For example, a search `.tif|source=imagej` would look for images that contain both `.tif` and `source=imagej` either in their name or metadata
* New 'Run > Use compiled scripts' option to reuse compiled versions of a script where possible
  * This can improve performance (slightly...) when re-running scripts many times
  * This is an experimental feature, currently turned off by default - please be on the lookout for any unexpected behavior


#### New & improved commands
* Pixel classifier improvements
  * Making measurements is *much* faster in some circumstances (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1076)
  * It's possible to restrict live prediction more closely to annotated regions ((https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1076))
  * Warn if trying to train a pixel classifier with too many features (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/947)
* New 'Analyze > Spatial analysis > Signed distance to annotations 2D' command (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1032)
* New 'Objects > Lock... >' commands
  * Enables annotations & TMA cores to be locked, so they cannot accidentally be moved or edited (deletion is still possible)
  * Toggle the 'locked' status of any selected object with `Ctrl/Cmd + K`
  * View locked status for annotations under the 'Annotation' tab
* New 'TMA > Specify TMA grid' command to manually specify a TMA grid (rather than relying on the dearrayer)
* 'Rotate annotation' command renamed to 'Transform annotation', and now supports applying the transform to *all* objects (not just one selected annotation)
* New 'Measure > Grid views' commands
  * Based on the old 'TMA > TMA grid summary view'... but no longer restricted only to TMAs
* 'Classify > Training images > Create region annotations' supports adding regions within a selected annotation
  * `RoiTools.createRandomRectangle()` methods created for scripting


#### Core improvements
* All objects can now have IDs
  * This aims to make it much easier to match up objects whenever some further analysis is done elsewhere (e.g. classification or clustering in Python or R)
  * See https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/959
* Much improved scripting support for classifications and measurements (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1094)
* Updated method names in `PathObjectHierarchy` for better consistency (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1109)
* TMACoreObjects now use 'caseID' rather than 'uniqueID' for clarity (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1114)
* Use `URI` in method names consistently, instead of sometimes switching to `Uri` (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1114)
* Remove ROI shape from `PathObject.toString()` (and therefore list cells) in favor of showing z/t indexes
  * Shape is usually evident from ROI icons & can still be seen in measurement tables
* OpenCV is no longer a dependency of qupath-core (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/961)
  * Moved `OpenCVTypeAdapters` to qupath-core-processing
  * Switched `BufferedImageTools.resize` to use ImageJ internally
* Use `-Djts.overlay=ng` system property by default with Java Topology Suite
  * This should resolve many occurrences of the dreaded `TopologyException` when manipulating ROIs & geometries
* Reduced use of Java serialization
  * Serialization filters now used to better control deserialized classes
* Improved percentile calculations in `OpenCVTools`
  * Output changed to match with NumPy, R and other software
  * Performance should be much improved when calculating percentiles from large arrays
* `ImageOps` now supports both per-channel and joint percentile normalization
* [Deep Java Library](https://djl.ai) dependencies added - activated via the [QuPath Deep Java Library extension](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-djl)
  * TensorFlow and PyTorch engines included by default for convenience
  * Create a custom QuPath build with different engines & model zoos, e.g. using `./gradlew jpackage -Pdjl.engines=mxnet,onnxruntime,pytorch -Pdjl.zoos=all`


#### Code & scripting improvements
* *See https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1078 for more detail*
* New classes & methods
  * Added `getTileObjects()` scripting method (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1065)
  * Added `checkMinVersion(version)` and `checkVersionRange(min, max)` methods to block scripts running with the wrong QuPath version
  * Added `Timeit` class to checkpoint & report running times
  * Adapted `getCurrentImageData()` and `getProject()` to return those open in the viewer if not called from a running script (rather than null)
  * Call `fireHierarchyUpdate()` automatically, so there's no need to remember to add it to many scripts
* API changes (improvements...)
  * Replaced `ImageServer.readBufferedImage()` with `readRegion()`, and made `RegionRequest` optional
    * Retrieve pixels with `server.readRegion(downsample, x, y, width, height, z, t)` (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1072)
  * Replaced `PathObject.get/setColorRGB(Integer)` with `PathObject.get/setColor(Integer)` and `PathObject.setColor(int, int, int)` (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1086)
    * Improved consistency with `PathClass`, optionally provide unpacked r, g and b values
* GeoJSON improvements (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/pull/1099)
  * Simplified representation of `PathClass`
    * Store either `name` (single name) or `names` (array) field, and `color` (3-element int array)
  * Flag ellipse ROIs so these can be deserialized as ellipses, not polygons
    * A polygon representation is still stored for use in other software, if required
  * Store measurements directly as a JSON object / map (rather than an array of name/value elements)
  * Optionally support child objects in export
    * Serializing the root object now involves serializing the whole hierarchy
* Simplify setting new accelerators (key combinations) via scripts
  * Example: `getQuPath().setAccelerator("File>Open...", "shift+o")`
  * Added `QuPathGUI.lookupAccelerator(combo)` methods to check if a key combinations are already registered
* Directory choosers can now have titles (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/940)
* Added `getCurrentImageName()` method to `QP` for scripting (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1009)
* Code cleaned up and simplified, with older (previously deprecated) detection classifiers removed
  * `PathClassifierTools` methods have been moved to `PathObjectTools` and `ServerTools`
* Support passing arguments via a map to `runPlugin`, rather than only a JSON-encoded String
* Add `difference`, `symDifference` and `subtract` methods to `RoiTools` (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/995)
* Add `ROI.updatePlane(plane)` method to move a ROI to a different z-slice or timepoint (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/1052)
* Improved OME-TIFF export
  * Better performance when writing large & multi-channel images
  * Optionally cast to a different pixel type, via `OMEPyramidWriter.Builder.pixelType(type)`
* Improved `LabeledImageServer.Builder` options
  * Use `grayscale()` to export images without an extra lookup table (easier to import in some other software; see https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/993)
  * Use `.shuffleInstanceLabels(false)` to avoid shuffling objects with `useInstanceLabels()`

### Enhancements
* Support for importing & exporting objects without scripting
  * Export objects as GeoJSON without via *File > Object data... > ...*
  * Import objects from .json, .geojson & .qpdata files via *File > Object data... > Import objects* or with drag & drop
* Pixel classifier usability improvements
  * Set number of threads for live prediction (under 'Advanced options' during training, or the vertical ellipsis button when loading a previous classifier)
  * New 'Show as text' option to check classifier parameters
  * Switch between pixel classifiers & density maps by bringing the corresponding window into focus
  * Perform live prediction starting from the center of the field of view or image
* Script editor improvements

  * Specify script parameters with the `--args` option
  * Make contents of any extensions directory available to the classloader
  * Return a non-zero exit code if an exception is thrown (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/654)
* New 'Optional args' when importing images
  * This allows options such as `--dims XYTZC --series 2` to be passed to Bio-Formats to customize image import
  * Reordering of RGB channels can be done with `--order BGR` or similar combinations
* New `ContourTracing` class to simplify converting thresholded and labeled images to ROIs and objects
* New `PathObjectTools.transformObjectRecursive` method to simplify applying an affine transformation to objects
* New `UriResource` and `UriUpdater` classes to support fixing broken paths generally (not just image paths in projects)
* Many improvements to ImageOps and OpenCVTools to make scripting with OpenCV much easier
* Translucent overlay for live prediction (useful to identify if a tile has been processed when at least one class is transparent)
* Better support for setting pixel sizes & z-spacing in µm
  * Access by double-clicking pixel size values under the 'Image' tab
  * Pixel size changes are now logged to the Workflow for inclusion in auto-generated scripts
* *Objects > Annotations... > Rotate annotation* now works with point annotations

  * Previously this was only accessible in the preferences
* Load object & pixel classifier dialogs support importing classifiers from other locations
* Brightness/Contrast panel shows small min/max values to 2 decimal places
* Better validation when entering numeric values in text fields
* BufferedImageOverlays are now tied to the pixel classification display setting (rather than the detection display)
* Bio-Formats now optionally accepts URLs, not only local files (requires opt-in through the preferences)
* Specify the logging level for the current QuPath session through the preferences, e.g. to emit extra debugging messages
  * Log files are now turned off by default; this can be changed in the preferences if a QuPath user directory is set
* Optionally use `qupath.prefs.name` system property to use a different preferences location, enabling multiple QuPath installations to have distinct preferences
* Provide optional launch scripts and `-Pld-path=true` Gradle options for Linux to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and work around pixman problems (https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/628)
* When setting stain vectors, do not overwrite the last workflow step if it was also used to set stain vectors
  * This makes it possible to go back to earlier stains if needed
* New `locateFile(nameOrPath)` scripting method to search for files within the current project and/or user directory

### Code changes
* Revised `PathClass` code to be more strict with invalid class names & prevent accidentally calling the constructor (please report any related bugs!)
* GeoJSON features now use "properties>object_type" rather than "id" property to map to a QuPath object type (e.g. "annotation", "detection", "cell")
  * 'id' is likely to be used as a unique identifier in a later QuPath version
* Updates to `TileExporter`, with some change in behavior
  * Creating a `TileExporter` using `parentObjects` now exports fixed-sized tiles centered on the object ROI. To export the ROI bounding box instead, set `useROIBounds(true)` when creating the exporter.

-----

## Version 0.1.2

* New 'View -> Show slide label' option added to make labels easier to find
* Added 'Analyze -> Cell analysis -> Subcellular detection' command (still experimental, for early testing & feedback)
* Minor changes to display names of detection classifiers to match with OpenCV's names (functionality unaffected)
* Fixed bug that prevented images being opened if OpenSlide native libraries could not be found
* Fixed estimate of image size used when opening non-pyramidal images
* Fixed bug that prevented 3rd stain vector being set through the GUI if it was previously set to be the 'residual' stain, when image type is 'Brightfield (Other)'

* New 'getCellObjects' scripting method
* New, non-default PathClasses are now assigned a random color (rather than black)
* Modified default color for 'Stroma' classifications, to improve contrast
* Using PROJECT_BASE_DIR in a script now fails with an appropriate error when called without a corresponding project
* Added experimental guiscript option for running short GUI-oriented scripts in the JavaFX Platform thread ([example](https://gist.github.com/petebankhead/6f73a01a67935dae2f7fa75fabe0d6ee))
* DialogHelperFX methods can now be called from any thread (not only the Platform thread)
* Improved number formatting within numeric fields
* ImageJ macro runner supports parallel processing (experimental)
* ImageJ macro runner now prompts to select all TMA cores if none are selected

-----

## Version 0.1.1

* Updated build script to produce Windows distribution without requiring installation
* Turned off grouping when formatting numbers for display & export (i.e. 1000.1 rather than 1,000.1) to reduce ambiguity across different regions
* Added support for locale-specific import of text data
* Fixed several typos within the user interface
* Added getMenuItem(String) method to main QuPathGUI class
* Improved menu organization, removing several incomplete commands ('Cluster objects (experimental)' & 'OpenCV superpixel test')

-----

## Version 0.1.0

* Fixed bug in 'Show setup options' that made it difficult to return changed region settings back to the default (but any other change was ok)
* Improved consistency of formatting used to display numbers based on other Locales
* Switched default to US Locale
* Removed pre-release notification
* Switched build to request a system rather than user installation (mostly so as to automatically request admin privileges on Windows)

-----

## Version 0.0.7

* New 'Show setup options' dialog to encourage choosing important settings when QuPath is first used.
* 'Fast cell counts' has numerous improvements, including displaying detections closer to the true nucleus center, giving a more informative error message when applied to a non-brightfield image, automatic calculation of a suitable magnification, and including an option to adjust the displayed detection size
* Positive cell densities now calculated dynamically for annotations, or TMA cores containing single annotations with positive cells contained therein.
* Several default parameter values changed for 'Fast cell counts' and 'Simple tissue detection' for better generalization across different image types.
* Added ROI centroids to measurement tables.
* Added sample script to estimate background RGB values for brightfield images; this improves optical density calculations (but without adjusting stain vectors).
* 'Optical density sum' color transform display now incorporates RGB max values (previously these only influenced processing, but not the visualization provided by the Brightness/Contrast command).
* The 'TMA data viewer' now includes p-values in plot legends, for better figure creation.
* The 'TMA data viewer' adds an optional display of 'At risk' patients for survival curves.
* Added new OpenCV and OpenSlide binaries to address portability issues on Linux.
* Added new OpenSlide binaries for macOS to fix bug that prevented some *.mrxs files opening (if bmps were involved).
* Fixed bug that caused scripts that logged a lot of text to cause the user interface to become sluggish or freeze.
* Fixed bug where cell detections were added to the wrong slice of a z-stack or time series.
* Fixed bug that prevent Haralick textures being calculated for red, green or blue channels of an RGB image.

-----

## Version 0.0.6

* Better support for ImageJ TIFF images, including multi-channel fluorescence, 16 and 32-bit.
* Improved sliders and behavior when working with z-stacks or time series.
* Improved behavior for 'Brightness/Contrast' pane, including ability to set channel color for fluorescence images by double-clicking on the channel name.
* Wand tool now uses current color transform information, giving another way to influence how it works.
* When sending back an annotation from ImageJ's macro runner, its shape will be automatically trimmed to fit inside the region that was sent to ImageJ.
* New 'Use calibrated location text' preference to toggle units used in the location text shown on the bottom right of the viewer.
* Default for new installations is to invert scrolling for Windows and Linux.
* Fixed 'Add intensity features' bug, where the median was calculated whether it was wanted or not.

-----

## Version 0.0.5

* Cell detection now works for fluorescence images as well as for brightfield
* New (experimental, subject to change) 'Analyze -> Region identification -> SLIC superpixel segmentation' command to generate superpixels based on the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) method
* New 'Object -> Expand annotations' command to create annotations that have been dilated (or eroded) by a fixed distance
* 'Analyze -> Region identification -> Create tiles' command can now be used to create annotations instead of standard tiles, or to split a single large annotation into smaller annotations
* Script editor improvements, including a better design and more informative error messages to help identify the line where any problem occurred
* Improvements to how the object hierarchy adds objects with complex ROI shapes, where the ROI centroid falls outside the ROI itself
* Improvements to how 'Simple tissue detection' handles thresholds that are set to detect the 'opposite' of what is normally expected, e.g. to detect holes inside tissue (by adjusting the 'dark background' and 'exclude on boundary' settings accordingly)
* 'Fast cell counts' can now be used to get a very rough (but very quick) estimate of positive cell percentages
* 'Add intensity features' command now always prompts to confirm the objects to which it will be applied, and splits large regions into tiles if needed
* 'Median' option added to 'Add intensity features' command
* The 'ImageJ macro runner' now works more predictably with selected objects, and shows error messages if no objects are selected or a requested region is too large
* Fixed Windows bug that meant trying to open a .qpdata file relating to an image that has been moved failed catastrophically.  Now a prompt should appear, elegantly asking for the new image path.
* Locale information now stored in .qpdata files.  This (hopefully) fixed a critical bug affecting computers where the locale used commas to separate decimal values (i.e. #,### rather than #.###), which previously prevented QuPath from reopening saved data files.
* Installer now requests a Desktop shortcut to be created by default.

-----

## Version 0.0.4

* Added check for updates on QuPath startup
* Made pre-release notice less obtrusive
* Added 'Measure -> Show measurement manager' command to enable measurements to be viewed & (optionally) removed
* Added 'File -> Revert' command to go back to the last saved version for the current image data
* Added new 'Add intensity features (experimental)' command. This will eventually replace the Haralick features command (and possibly others), since it offers the same functionality in a much more flexible way.  Furthermore, the new command can handle up to 8 channels of fluorescence data (with arbitrary setting of the min/max values used to calculate the graylevel co-occurrence matrix).
* Major updates to the 'Add Delaunay cluster features (experimental)' command, with improved display and ability to save connections within the ImageData properties.
* Major updates to the 'TMA data viewer', with improved performance and a tree-table structure.
* Improved 'Tile classifications to annotations' command to support tile-based region identification
* Improved 'Simple tissue detection' command with support for detecting tissue inside TMACoreObjects
* Improved TMA dearrayer speed & accuracy
* TMA core labels can now optionally have leading zeros (e.g. 01-16), or be in descending order (e.g. J-A)
* TMA grids can be applied to add TMA 'Unique ID' values by drag-and-drop, using a text file with extension '.qpmap'
* Adding or removing a TMA row or column now produces a prompt to relabel the grid
* When sending image regions to ImageJ, the 'visibility' status is used to determine whether or not objects are sent as ROIs
* Fixed bug with extension path wrongly defaulting to an internal QuPath directory (existing installations may require the extension directory to be updated from 'Edit -> Preferences')
* Fixed (hopefully) cross-platform line splitting (v0.0.3 tried to fix this for Windows... but only partly did, while breaking TMA grid import elsewhere)
* Fixed bugs in 'Classify by specific feature' command
* Fixed bug whereby ROIs with zero width or height were not shown at all
* Fixed bug in drawing ROIs as icons (e.g. in the annotation or hierarchy views)
* When manually setting the name of an annotation, any previous name is now shown (rather than a blank field)

-----

## Version 0.0.3

* Fixed several formatting issues for Windows, including:
  * Import of tab-delimited data (e.g. TMA grids)
  * Escaping of paths when exporting TMA data
  * Separation of paths in 'Help -> System info'
  * Cached image paths (still experimental)
* TMA data export now records directory (rather than name) in script, so that it can be reused across a project without editing
* Added use of OpenSlide's background color - this fixes previously-buggy appearance when scans where part of the image is omitted (e.g. some mrxs images)
* Updated TMA dearraying command to support fluorescence TMAs
* Modified TMA dearraying script command to abort if dearraying for the first time by default - this encourages good practice of checking dearrayed result prior to running full analysis (although means that any generated script would need to be run twice - once to dearray, and then again to do everything else)
* 'Relabel TMA Grid' now a scriptable command
* Fixed reassigning child objects with 'Make inverse annotation' command
* Fixed bug that prevented plugins cancelling more than once
* Minor improvements to Brightness/Contrast panel
* Set default logging level to INFO
* Added sample script to change logging level
* Improved display of licenses & third-party dependencies
* Updated location of user preferences
* Added menu entry to reset preferences

-----

## Version 0.0.2

* New Help menu links to online resources
* Source code now included for dependencies (from Maven)
* 'Objects -> Create full image annotation' command is now scriptable
* Error notification now displayed if an image can't be opened
* Extension ClassLoader changes to help add dependencies (without copying or symbolic linking)
* Fixed some weird behavior when multiple images are contained in the same file

-----

## Version 0.0.1-beta

* First available version under GPL.  Arguably with an overly-conservative version number.
